# Search-Engine-Optimization
HORISEON

## Description

-The main goal is to create a codebase/site that utilizes all the potential for various search engines. Allowing only the highest acessability standards for our customer base.
-Through extensive editing and re-writing I was able to create a page that is fully functional and operable for various types of full screen desktops.  
-As I performed extensive research for this code base I learned that various sections of this code were not composed correctly, with little adjustments through dev tools i was able to repair numerous sections of the codebase.
